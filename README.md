# Rule_Based_Chatbot

📌 Overview

This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
The chatbot uses if-elif-else conditions to respond to user queries, simulating a basic conversational AI.

It demonstrates the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) structure without using ML or AI libraries.
This project is perfect for beginners in AI, Python, and web development.

🎯 Features

✅ Rule-based chatbot logic using Python if-else

✅ Flask backend to handle chat requests

✅ Frontend chat UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

✅ Real-time conversation between user and bot

✅ Simple & Beginner-friendly structure

✅ Responsive chatbox with scrolling & styled messages

🛠️ Technologies Used

Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Tools: JSON for data exchange, Fetch API for AJAX

🚀 How It Works

User enters a message in the chatbox.

The message is sent to the Flask backend using AJAX (Fetch API).

Flask processes the message with a rule-based if-elif-else chatbot.

The bot’s response is sent back as JSON.

JavaScript updates the chat UI with the bot’s reply.
